      "Another absolute classic. Beer Pong involves attempting to throw a ping pong ball into your opposition's cup, resulting in them drinking the contents. At either ends of a kitchen table / counter top/ ping pong table, put six cups in a triangle shape. In teams, take it in turns to throw the ball into your opposition's cups from your end, being sure to be transparent with your rules from the beginning. Is the ball allowed to bounce? Are you allowed to hit the rim? The winning team is the one who lands the ball in all of the opposition's cups before they do it to you.",

      "Everyone knows how to play charades, it's a universal classic. Start by dividing your party into teams, and have one person from your team try and act out a book, film, song, etc. while you try and guess what it is as quickly as possible. The more competitive your group is, the louder it will get, so only go for this one if you can handle being shouted at by your best mate.",

      "Everybody knows this one, don't they? It's an absolute classic (just maybe not one for Christmas Dinner with your parents!) The rules follow a simple 'Fill in the blank' format. Everyone is dealt 10 white cards, which are the options for 'filling of the blank'. One black card is then drawn, which contains the blank that people have to fill. Each player then chooses one of their white cards which they think best fills the gap, and puts them face down on the table. The person who drew the black cards reads the sentence aloud, filling in the blank with the different options each time, and then chooses the funniest as the winner of that round. The person who wins the most rounds, wins.",

      "A real crowd pleaser, the Head's Up app makes party games a doddle. Once you've downloaded it, one person picks a category (whether that's Superstars, Act It Out, Animals or more), and puts the phone to their head. The phone will then display words within that category, and the other players on that person's team have to describe the word without actually saying it, within a time limit. Once the person guesses correctly, they nod the phone forward, and it moves on to the next word. The winning team is the one that guesses the most words in the time limit.",

      'This game is also known as Assassin, Werewolf, or Village. If you have a large group, a deck of cards, a lot of time, and long attention spans, this intense puzzle of a game is a lot of fun, if a little complicated. See the full rules for Mafia; essentially, certain members of the group are the bad guys (the mafia, assassins, etc.); others are villagers, and still more are police officers. One is the game moderator. The police officers are trying to guess who the bad guys are before they can kill all the villagers.',

      'The goal of the game is to get a mahjong, which consists of getting all 14 of your tiles into four sets and one pair. A pair is two identical tiles. A set can either be a "pung," which is three identical tiles, or a "chow," which is a run of three consecutive numbers in the same suit. A single tile cannot be used in two sets at once.',

      "Okay, it's a popular party game for kids, but adults can also get in on the fun. Set up chairs (or seat cushions) in a circle facing outward, with enough seating for everyone playing, minus one. Designate one person as the music player and have everyone else stand in a circle around the circle of seats. When the music starts, walk around the seats; everyone must find a seat when the music ends. Whoever doesn't is out. Remove one more chair and begin again, until two people are fighting for one seat. To make musical chairs more interesting, add your own rules. Allow people to sit on top of each other (as long as their feet are off the floor), for example, or make your own alterations.",
